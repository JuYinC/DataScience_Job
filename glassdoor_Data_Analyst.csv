You'll use tools like Preset and Tableau to unlock the potential of our rapidly growing data sets, uncover hidden trends, and transform raw information into actionable insights. Your work will extend beyond the confines of your desk as you collaborate closely with executive leadership and represent your findings to the entire company.

You'll have the opportunity to interact regularly with our executive team, presenting your insights and recommendations and contributing to the overall growth and success of the organization. Your expertise will be valued, and your contributions will have a tangible impact on the company's trajectory.
This role reports to our Vice President of Data Science and will be supported by our larger Data Science and Software Engineering teams.
MarginEdge: &nbsp;Where hospitality meets technology &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
As a team built by former (and current!) restaurant operators, our mission is to bring operators the same energy, attention to detail, and passion that they bring to their guests. Our culture is deeply rooted in service, partially because that’s where so many of our team come from (including everyone on our Business Development team), but also because we believe it is just the right way to run a business. We design our software with profound empathy for the complexity of running a restaurant, and the goal of making the magic just a little easier for operators by taking the complex (read: very annoying) back office tasks off their plate, while empowering them with real-time data.&nbsp;
Our founders share a deep history in both owning and operating restaurants and in building successful tech companies. We are venture-backed and serve 4,400+ restaurants across the US and Canada.
We enable restaurants to make magic while knowing we are doing the same for them. &nbsp;
Essential Functions / Responsibilities
Use our reporting infrastructure and data warehouse to curate data, build reports, and analyze data for trends and patterns important to support the company's daily operations. &nbsp;
Help determine and document the meaning behind our standard vocabulary at the company and ensure there is only one correct answer to any given question. &nbsp;If someone speaks about churn or revenue growth we need to all mean the same thing and have one authoritative place to go for the answer.
Learn everything about the MarginEdge data model. &nbsp;Guide the development of a data model that will support reporting on strategic initiatives for the company. Be an active participant in our code review process for reports. &nbsp;
Respond to feedback from others and provide a quality check on reports built by other teams at the company.&nbsp;
Collaborate closely with executive leadership, offering strategic insights and recommendations to drive key business decisions.
Qualifications
3+ years of experience in data analysis or business intelligence field
Bachelor’s degree in statistics, mathematics, management, or business analytics program is preferred
Proficient in SQL
Experience with Tableau, Preset, or other modern business intelligence/reporting platforms
Some capability in R or Python for data analysis is a plus
Strong communication skills, with the ability to effectively present complex data to non-technical stakeholders.
Strong problem-solving skills and a passion for finding patterns and trends within data.
Experience using Salesforce for reporting or analysis would be a bonus
What’s it like to work for MarginEdge? &nbsp;&nbsp;
Imagine the fun of a great restaurant - surrounded by a team of people (including some that you help to manage!) who care about hospitality, care about quality, and care about each other - then subtract the long nights, weekends, drunk customers at the bar...et voila, MarginEdge! &nbsp;
&nbsp;
We work hard, we work fast and we fuel our work with a commitment of transparency from leadership, straight talk and trust between teams. We believe that the best people do their best work when they feel empowered - so whether you are remote or in our office (likely eating a catered lunch from our clients in our baller, brand new penthouse HQ in Ballston) you get to work with your manager to call your shot on what works best for you. Did we mention it has a full commercial kitchen and is walking distance (covered walking, that is) from the metro? &nbsp;
&nbsp;
Benefits (Shut the Front Door, They are Amazing)&nbsp;
To fuel this rocket ship, we need to build a team as passionate about our work and product as we are. We believe that top talent (that’s you!) should feel deeply connected to their work, appreciated for the time they give to building our organization, and have the balance necessary to give their best during work hours and all those after-hours too. &nbsp;&nbsp;
We do this by offering a suite of kick-ass benefits not only to be competitive and catch the eye of super-smart people (that’s you again!) but also to provide the foundation for a career you love and a life outside of work you love just as much. &nbsp;

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As our first marketing analyst, you will play a critical role in accelerating Notion's growth by building and improving how we measure the impact of all of our marketing efforts. You will work closely with our marketing, data science and engineering teams to inform and define marketing metrics and targets, analyze campaign performance, build monitoring dashboards for key marketing channels, and shape the processes for how we measure and analyze marketing data across Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You will apply your expertise in data mining and data presentation, as well as your deep knowledge of marketing channels and platforms, to identify opportunities for improving Notion's marketing strategy beyond the numbers.
You will partner closely with all marketing teams to make critical decisions about where we invest our marketing efforts, understanding the impact of our business, and building segmentations and metrics.
You will collaborate with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain dashboards that these teams rely on for monitoring progress, understanding our users and making decisions.
You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our marketing channel spend. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data analyst/data scientist partnering with business functions ideally with various marketing teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.
You are an expert in SQL and have experience with Excel.
You have built clean data visualizations and dashboards before using modern business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker etc).
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You are familiar with a scripting language for analytics, ideally Python or R.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have solid experience working with marketing teams to drive decision-making.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
