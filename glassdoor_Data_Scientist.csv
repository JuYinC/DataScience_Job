We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You’ll explore Notion’s data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll explore Notion's data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role's scope and complexity, and the candidate's experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below.

Department Description
This is a joint position between two UCSF faculty: Dr. Jessica Neely, a pediatric rheumatologist and translational research, and Dr. Gabriela Fragiadakis, a computational immunologist and Director of the Data Science CoLab.

The Neely Lab: Dr. Neely is a pediatric rheumatologist who studies a rare pediatric condition known as juvenile dermatomyositis using multi-modal single cell technologies of biological samples collected from her patients. Her research seeks to identify novel treatment targets and biomarkers for this condition to develop precision medicine approaches to care. In this position, projects will range from computational drug repurposing using bulk and single cell RNAseq data, analysis of single-cell drug perturbations, bulk and single cell repertoire analysis with clonal lineage tracing, analysis of CyTOF data, integration of single cell data with datasets generated from similar diseases (like Lupus), and multi-omic (proteomic and transcriptomic) markers of treatment response in a multi-center cohort.

The Fragiadakis Lab/Data Science CoLab:
The Fragiadakis Lab/Data Science CoLab is a computational immunology lab studying states of the human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and data integration. We work with a variety of data types, including bulk- and single-cell sequencing and CyTOF. Dr. Fragiadakis’s research program is built from a foundation of collaborations as Director of the Data Science CoLab. Through CoLabs we have established partnerships to study systems-level immunity in viral infection, cancer, autoimmunity, and steady-state. From these projects the lab then pursues questions in immune phenotypes across contexts using high-dimensional analysis, data integration, and novel computational methods. In addition, we study immune-microbiome interactions at steady-state and in response to perturbation. In the lab we have a sub-team that builds and develops the UCSF Data Library project, a web-based platform to store, curate, share and analyze high-dimensional data.

The CoLabs:
CoLabs is a new model for research collaborations for the UCSF community. CoLabs brings together several established and successful but previously separate cores plus two new academic labs (Data Science and Disease to Biology) and renewed institutional support into a new centralized research organization at the Parnassus campus. CoLabs seeks to revitalize the model for shared resources by capitalizing on critical personnel and cutting-edge technologies and driving collaboration across disciplines. CoLabs will centralize research teams and create a set of common pipelines and workflows. It will recruit and retain world-class staff and develop transformative methods and technologies through engagement with the research community and institutional investments.

Department Description
This is a joint position between two UCSF faculty: Dr. Jessica Neely, a pediatric rheumatologist and translational research, and Dr. Gabriela Fragiadakis, a computational immunologist and Director of the Data Science CoLab.

The Neely Lab: Dr. Neely is a pediatric rheumatologist who studies a rare pediatric condition known as juvenile dermatomyositis using multi-modal single cell technologies of biological samples collected from her patients. Her research seeks to identify novel treatment targets and biomarkers for this condition to develop precision medicine approaches to care. In this position, projects will range from computational drug repurposing using bulk and single cell RNAseq data, analysis of single-cell drug perturbations, bulk and single cell repertoire analysis with clonal lineage tracing, analysis of CyTOF data, integration of single cell data with datasets generated from similar diseases (like Lupus), and multi-omic (proteomic and transcriptomic) markers of treatment response in a multi-center cohort.

The Fragiadakis Lab/Data Science CoLab:
The Fragiadakis Lab/Data Science CoLab is a computational immunology lab studying states of the human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and data integration. We work with a variety of data types, including bulk- and single-cell sequencing and CyTOF. Dr. Fragiadakis’s research program is built from a foundation of collaborations as Director of the Data Science CoLab. Through CoLabs we have established partnerships to study systems-level immunity in viral infection, cancer, autoimmunity, and steady-state. From these projects the lab then pursues questions in immune phenotypes across contexts using high-dimensional analysis, data integration, and novel computational methods. In addition, we study immune-microbiome interactions at steady-state and in response to perturbation. In the lab we have a sub-team that builds and develops the UCSF Data Library project, a web-based platform to store, curate, share and analyze high-dimensional data.

The CoLabs:
CoLabs is a new model for research collaborations for the UCSF community. CoLabs brings together several established and successful but previously separate cores plus two new academic labs (Data Science and Disease to Biology) and renewed institutional support into a new centralized research organization at the Parnassus campus. CoLabs seeks to revitalize the model for shared resources by capitalizing on critical personnel and cutting-edge technologies and driving collaboration across disciplines.

Logistics
Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

Benefits - Benefits we offer include:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.
401(k) plan with 4% matching.

Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.
Fertility benefits via Carrot.
Daily lunches and snacks in our office.
Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.

This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll explore Notion's data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

"Research Scientist, Machine Learning / AI",-1,Basis3.8 ★,Remote,"About Basis
Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
