You might not be called a “Business Analyst” by title, but that’s what you’ve done—reviewed systems, suggested improvements, and helped your IT department make an impact in the business. Now you’re ready to do it for others… and that’s why we should talk. It’s time to throw your hat in the ring and see what you’re capable of!
Resource Data is a GIS and software development consulting company working on projects in a variety of industries. Our Business Analysts work directly with clients, adding value by helping our development teams be more effective and successful. A career here as a Business Analyst probably looks a bit different than it does in other businesses. Let’s take a look at what it might be like.
In the first 30 days…
You’ve started a project, introduced yourself to the client and stakeholders, and already sat through your first project meeting.
More importantly, you’ve come up to speed on a brand-new industry and you’re excited to learn more..
After 90 days, you’re hitting your stride…
You’ve started producing documents that helps the technical team deliver meaningful functionality.
You’ve built a rapport with the client and they appreciate your objective analysis of their business processes. They are now inviting you to attend brainstorming sessions.
You’ve been able to work with disparate business systems and system owners to facilitate data exchange and system integration within the business.
Your calm and confident demeanor has allowed you to easily navigate potentially difficult client situations.
One year after you’ve started, let’s look at some of the things you can do…
You’ve now worked on several projects and have developed relationships with coworkers and clients; you now consider them friends.
You’ve gained technical skills so that you can identify data element inconsistencies between systems. The development team completely trusts and respects your analysis ability.
You’re participating in some of RDI’s internal working groups and taking on a few targeted initiatives to improve internal processes and standards.
Your ability to quickly digest and remember information now spans into the technical realm. Many of the senior developers appreciate your ideas for resolving logical and technical problems.
Regardless of the forum or medium, you’re able to follow along and contribute to important discussions at the right time.
Simply put: the projects you’re on stay on track, and clients are happy with the results.
Could you see yourself on this sort of trajectory? You may wonder: What background do I need? Am I qualified? Excellent written and verbal communication skills are a must, as is some level of proficiency with software packages like Microsoft Office and Visio. We also expect some previous exposure to IT projects. That being said, we’re way more interested in what you’ve done than what your skills are, so please tell us a bit about yourself. Send us some examples of going above and beyond. What are some of the projects and achievements you are most proud of? Tell us a bit about those and your contribution. We’re excited to hear from you.
Resource Data is a consulting company—clients hire us because we’re good, and we deliver results. Expectations are high, but the work is never boring. We support our employees with long-term stability, schedule flexibility, a healthy work-life balance, and great coworkers.

MarginEdge is seeking a talented Data Analyst to join our team and make a significant impact on our rapidly growing data-driven business. This is not your typical data analyst role; it's an exciting opportunity to shape the future of our company through data-driven insights and innovation.As a Data Analyst at MarginEdge, you will be crucial in producing and delivering data products that drive critical business decisions. You'll use tools like Preset and Tableau to unlock the potential of our rapidly growing data sets, uncover hidden trends, and transform raw information into actionable insights. Your work will extend beyond the confines of your desk as you collaborate closely with executive leadership and represent your findings to the entire company.
Imagine the satisfaction of knowing that your analysis and visualizations directly influence strategic decisions made by our top leaders. You'll have the opportunity to interact regularly with our executive team, presenting your insights and recommendations and contributing to the overall growth and success of the organization. Your expertise will be valued, and your contributions will have a tangible impact on the company's trajectory.
This role reports to our Vice President of Data Science and will be supported by our larger Data Science and Software Engineering teams.
MarginEdge: &nbsp;Where hospitality meets technology &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
As a team built by former (and current!) restaurant operators, our mission is to bring operators the same energy, attention to detail, and passion that they bring to their guests. Our culture is deeply rooted in service, partially because that’s where so many of our team come from (including everyone on our Business Development team), but also because we believe it is just the right way to run a business. We design our software with profound empathy for the complexity of running a restaurant, and the goal of making the magic just a little easier for operators by taking the complex (read: very annoying) back office tasks off their plate, while empowering them with real-time data.&nbsp;
Our founders share a deep history in both owning and operating restaurants and in building successful tech companies. We are venture-backed and serve 4,400+ restaurants across the US and Canada.
We enable restaurants to make magic while knowing we are doing the same for them. &nbsp;
Essential Functions / Responsibilities
Use our reporting infrastructure and data warehouse to curate data, build reports, and analyze data for trends and patterns important to support the company's daily operations. &nbsp;
Help determine and document the meaning behind our standard vocabulary at the company and ensure there is only one correct answer to any given question. &nbsp;If someone speaks about churn or revenue growth we need to all mean the same thing and have one authoritative place to go for the answer.
Learn everything about the MarginEdge data model. &nbsp;Guide the development of a data model that will support reporting on strategic initiatives for the company. Be an active participant in our code review process for reports. &nbsp;
Respond to feedback from others and provide a quality check on reports built by other teams at the company.&nbsp;
Collaborate closely with executive leadership, offering strategic insights and recommendations to drive key business decisions.

Strong problem-solving skills and a passion for finding patterns and trends within data.
Experience using Salesforce for reporting or analysis would be a bonus
What’s it like to work for MarginEdge? &nbsp;&nbsp;
Imagine the fun of a great restaurant - surrounded by a team of people (including some that you help to manage!) who care about hospitality, care about quality, and care about each other - then subtract the long nights, weekends, drunk customers at the bar...et voila, MarginEdge! &nbsp;
&nbsp;
We work hard, we work fast and we fuel our work with a commitment of transparency from leadership, straight talk and trust between teams. We believe that the best people do their best work when they feel empowered - so whether you are remote or in our office (likely eating a catered lunch from our clients in our baller, brand new penthouse HQ in Ballston) you get to work with your manager to call your shot on what works best for you. Did we mention it has a full commercial kitchen and is walking distance (covered walking, that is) from the metro? &nbsp;
&nbsp;
Benefits (Shut the Front Door, They are Amazing)&nbsp;
To fuel this rocket ship, we need to build a team as passionate about our work and product as we are. We believe that top talent (that’s you!) should feel deeply connected to their work, appreciated for the time they give to building our organization, and have the balance necessary to give their best during work hours and all those after-hours too. &nbsp;&nbsp;
We do this by offering a suite of kick-ass benefits not only to be competitive and catch the eye of super-smart people (that’s you again!) but also to provide the foundation for a career you love and a life outside of work you love just as much. &nbsp;
Unlimited Paid Time Off (and we mean it, we encourage your healthy work-life balance!) &nbsp;&nbsp;

"Data Analyst, Marketing",$140K - $195K (Employer est.),Notion4.8 ★,"San Francisco, CA","About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As our first marketing analyst, you will play a critical role in accelerating Notion's growth by building and improving how we measure the impact of all of our marketing efforts. You will work closely with our marketing, data science and engineering teams to inform and define marketing metrics and targets, analyze campaign performance, build monitoring dashboards for key marketing channels, and shape the processes for how we measure and analyze marketing data across Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You will apply your expertise in data mining and data presentation, as well as your deep knowledge of marketing channels and platforms, to identify opportunities for improving Notion's marketing strategy beyond the numbers.
You will partner closely with all marketing teams to make critical decisions about where we invest our marketing efforts, understanding the impact of our business, and building segmentations and metrics.
You will collaborate with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain dashboards that these teams rely on for monitoring progress, understanding our users and making decisions.
You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our marketing channel spend. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data analyst/data scientist partnering with business functions ideally with various marketing teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.
You are an expert in SQL and have experience with Excel.
You have built clean data visualizations and dashboards before using modern business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker etc).
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You are familiar with a scripting language for analytics, ideally Python or R.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have solid experience working with marketing teams to drive decision-making.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You’ll explore Notion’s data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

"Data Scientist, Product",$160K - $255K (Employer est.),Notion4.8 ★,"San Francisco, CA","About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Do you want to help set the foundations for product and engineering data science at Notion? As an early member of the product and engineering data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll partner with a product or engineering pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll explore Notion's data using statistical inference or modeling techniques, identifying key patterns in user behavior and making actionable product and business recommendations based on that information.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and other product or engineering changes, and help your teams use these results to drive informed iteration.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering or growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role's scope and complexity, and the candidate's experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $160,000 - $255,000 per year.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

"Software Engineer, Machine Learning",$220K - $300K (Employer est.),Notion4.8 ★,"San Francisco, CA","About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role
We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion's product in a high quality way. You'll be exploring the boundaries of what's possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion's offering.
What You'll Achieve:
Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion's core product
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 6+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You're excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you're building.
Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.
Nice to Haves:
You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
You're proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals' strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

Your solutions will make a significant impact in patients' healing experience and how the caretakers monitor patient well-being.
Who You Are
You’re creative. You’re organized. You’re experienced. You’ve done this before. You want to do it again. We’re not looking for a superhero who thinks sheer hours = good work. Excess doesn’t impress us – creativity and efficiency do. You’ll have 8 hours a day to work, and, we hope, at least 8 hours a night to sleep.
You are a passionate software engineer with a deep understanding of what makes live, highly scalable platforms. You care deeply about bringing your unique engineering mind into creating a considerate and sustainable team and product.
You are autonomous - a manager of one. You enjoy working alone, you can make your own decisions and you will take full ownership of your work, assuming the responsibility for every detail, every step of the way.
You are a solid writer. You document your every decision so you don't just save the day, but make the lives of your future teammates easier.
Qualifications

Benefits
We work remotely and asynchronously, and that is why we are looking for a manager of one. But you will need to overlap for a few hours with San Francisco time in your normal work-day routine - this may mean a few hours of meetings in the evening depending on your time zone - we do our best to keep them short. We can provide you with space outside of your home to work if you need to (e.g. co-working offices), or help get your home to be more accommodating to work.
We do not trap people in front of their screens or lock them in overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours and ample vacation time. See our employee handbook here.
How To Apply
We want to get a sense of how you think and work. To that end, please be prepared to share with us your take on the following:
Tell us what you know about machine learning. How would you begin to approach figuring out where we stand with our technology, and where we should be standing?
Chart us an example of a machine learning pipeline that can support the needs of modern applications (related to detecting a person's activity)
What technologies inspired you recently? What machine learning technologies are you the most excited about?

You are interested in experimenting with new search technologies such as text similarity / vector search and deep learning ranking models
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up, a SaaS company, or are eager to contribute in such an environment (being a current Notion user would be great!)
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

LinkedIn tracking: #LI-DNI

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees:

This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
